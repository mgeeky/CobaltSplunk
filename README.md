## What is CobaltSplunk?

CobaltSplunk is a Splunk Application that knows how to 1) ingest Cobalt Strike related logs and parse them properly, 2) display useful operational dashboards, 3) display relevant reports.


## Usage

Manually:

0) Install Splunk
	We can grab _Splunk Enterprise Trial_ (Splunk Free) which gives us 60 days of enterprise features evaluation period.
	During that time we'll be limited to upload no more than 500MB of data per file.
	Download your `splunk-8.1.2-545206cc9f70-linux-2.6-amd64.deb` package, then hit:
	`$ sudo dpkg -i splunk-8.1.2-545206cc9f70-linux-2.6-amd64.deb`

	After getting Splunk installed, enable it to run on boot-start as well as setup Administration account's username & password:

	`$ sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start`

1) Download Cobalt.spl
2) Install as application: Apps -> Manage Apps -> Install app from file
   or using CLI: `$ /opt/splunk/bin/splunk install app <Cobalt.spl> -auth User:Password`

3) Ingest logs
	In a simplest way: 
		Add Data -> Monitor -> Files & Directories -> CobaltStrike logs directory
		-> Host: Regular expression on path -> Host field value: `\d{6}/([a-zA-Z-\._0-9]+)/\w+` -> Index: `cobalt` -> Save

4) View the dashboard and reports as you see fit

Or you can use automated script attached to this repository like so:

```
./install-splunk.sh <username> <password> <logs-path> [path-to-CobaltSplunk.spl]
```

The script will automatically create `cobalt` index if none exists, install CobaltSplunk application pointed by last argument, add `operator` role to the specified username, that has default index switched to `cobalt` (so that `Data Summary` functionality will include Cobalt Strike events by default) and add monitored Teamserver log files as specified by location supplied in third parameter of the script.

Example run:

```
$ ./install-splunk.sh admin Password1! /media/sf_vmshared/cobalt/linux/logs ./Cobalt.spl
```

## Getting Started

To build your first queries searching through Cobalt Strike logs, go to the Search view and open your query with one of the helper operators:

- `index=cobalt` - Tells Splunk to search through cobalt-related events
- `sourcetype=beacon_log` - Tells Splunk to search through specific logfiles/sourcetypes, further discussed below.
- `source="*beacon_137*.log"` - Examines specific source file with wildcards in its path.

After any of these operators are specified, you can start expanding your search queries by adding further statements, values and specific search conditions.

Example: 

_To find commands issued by specific operator:_

```
sourcetype=beacon_log type=input operator=mariusz
```

However this search query will return Events, which is not something especially readable and digestible. Therefore we can enhance that search query bit further to visualise it in form of a table perhaps:

```
sourcetype=beacon_log type=input operator=mariusz
| table _time host operator command
| sort _time
```

A bit better. How about filtering only entries that were issued on a specific host? No problem at all:

```
sourcetype=beacon_log type=input operator=mariusz host="192.168.50.14"
| table _time host operator command
| sort _time
```

## App Functionality

This Splunk app collects all events coming from Cobalt Strike data inputs in `index=cobalt` and defines several useful _sourcetypes_ based on supplied Cobalt Strike logs contents. 

Defined _sourcetypes_:

- `sourcetype=beacon_log` - Contains various log entries from `beacon_*.log` files.
- `sourcetype=weblog` - Teamserver Web Server access log entries `weblog_*.log` files.
- `sourcetype=screenshots` - List of screenshots taken by Beacons `screenshots.log` files.
- `sourcetype=teamserver_events` - Teamserver events log entries:  `events.log` files.
- `sourcetype=keystrokes` -  Keystrokes collected across Beacons `keystrokes_*.log` files.

These sourcetypes can facilitate searches by introducing pre-built regular expressions that extract interesting fields.

Each of these entries bring its own set of extracted fields, described below:

### `sourcetype=beacon_log`


Example log entries:

```
04/09 11:26:34 UTC [metadata] beacon_1830434858 -> 172.16.100.173; computer: DCORP-STD173; user: SYSTEM *; process: dllhost.exe; pid: 4364; os: Windows; version: 10.0; beacon arch: x64 (x64)
